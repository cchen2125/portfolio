# Portfolio
This repository includes some of my past projects related to computer science and data analytics including the following:

## CS50 Final Project (Flask, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Matplotlib)
This was my final project for "Introduction to Computer Science" (CS50), which I took in my first semester at Harvard.

## Harvard Open Data Project Bootcamp Article (Python, plotly)
During the fall semester of 2021, I completed the bootcamp process for the Harvard Open Data Project (HODP). For the final presentation of the bootcamp, I, along with other group members, analyzed survey data from Harvard students comparing their high school and college extracurriculars and academics. My main contributions to the group were creating the bar graphs of students' extracurriculars and academics (Figure 1 and Figure 4) and writing the academics portion of the article.
